### **Current Situation:**<br>
Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. 

### **Task:**<br>
The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:
1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are.
2. They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money.
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
5. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
7. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
8. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
9. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
10. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

### **Objective:**<br>
The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and uncover patterns for growth.
